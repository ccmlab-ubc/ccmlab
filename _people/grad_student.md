We are looking for highly motivated and curious students who want to learn more about the brain and how we (humans) acquire, adapt, and refine a seemingly limitless repertoire of motor skills. Our work is at the borders of cognitive psychology, cognitive/computational neuroscience, and kinesiology. Experience with experimental design, coding, and/or data analysis are desirable but not absolutely necessary. A strong interest in the research we do and a drive for discovery are more important than the skills you walk in with. To find out more, reach out to [Hyosub](https://ccmlab.org/people/hyosub_kim/index.html) to discuss whether this lab may be a good fit.
