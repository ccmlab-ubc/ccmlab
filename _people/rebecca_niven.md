### About me ###
I received my Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology in 2017 from the University of Lethbridge. Since then, I have worked clinically with individuals with chronic conditions, spinal cord injuries, neurological disorders and musculoskeletal injuries. My clinical experience has led to my interest in research and I am now pursing a Master of Science in Kinesiology. My research interests include sensorimotor control, motor adaptation and motor learning. In my free time, you can find me training for my upcoming marathon in May, learning to play tennis or camping with my dog.
