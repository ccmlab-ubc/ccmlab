### About me ###
I am in my final year as a Kinesiology undergrad at the University of British Columbia. Prior to joining the CCM Lab, I completed my undergraduate thesis under Dr. Jasmin Ma in the areas of knowledge translation, exercise prescription, and rheumatoid arthritis. I've also gained experience in industry-based research as a Labs Intern on the lululemon Product Innovation team, completed an exchange work practicum in Clinical Exercise Physiology in New Zealand, and have done work in the exoskeleton start-up space regarding business strategy. In my free time, I like to explore local BC mountains by either hiking, biking, or skiing.
