I am approaching my final year of undergrad studying kinesiology at the University of British Columbia. I've gained research experience from previous employment (research assistant at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, WorkLearn at Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre) in various research areas. I've also recently completed an independent directed studies in the Neural Control of Posture and Movement Lab investigating a novel apparatus for vestibular perception. This summer, I'm working as an NSERC USRA in the CCM lab exploring the realms of motor learning. In my free time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, music, and exploring BC.
