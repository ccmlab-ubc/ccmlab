I am entering my final year of undergraduate studies in Kinesiology at the University of British Columbia. I discovered a passion for research after taking Dr. Kimâ€™s computational modeling course, which inspired my interest in the field. I am continually amazed by how the brain navigates and makes sense of chaotic environments, let alone its own processes, and I have found a deep appreciation for advancing knowledge in this area. This summer, I am volunteering under Dr. Kim, focusing on motor learning and adaptation. In the fall of 2025, I will be conducting directed research in sensorimotor computational modeling. Outside of my studies, I love to spend my time being active, reading, and writing music.
