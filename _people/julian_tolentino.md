### About me ###
I am entering the 4th year of my Bachelor’s Degree in Neuroscience (with a focus in cellular and molecular neuroscience). Before meeting Dr. Kim and joining the CCM Lab, my research experience consisted mostly of research assignments through my coursework and my involvement with URO REX. Dr. Kim’s research in motor learning and adaptation has piqued my interest, as it allows us to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the processes underlying relatively simple movements that we perform on a daily basis, and has motivated me to join the CCM lab as a research assistant. Moving forward, I will be conducting an independent project in the field of motor adaptation under the supervision of Dr. Kim. Outside of academia, I enjoy playing basketball, going to the gym, and riding motorcycles.
