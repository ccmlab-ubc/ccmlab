My name is Jeremy Thomas and I am a first year PhD trainee in the Graduate Program in Neuroscience. I am co-supervised by Dr. Miriam Spering and Dr. Hyosub Kim. My research focuses on visually guided movement, and I am specifically interested in how humans integrate information from multiple sensory modalities into their actions. On top of doing cool research related to sensorimotor function, what brought me to Vancouver is the abundance of salmon, which I prefer brined and on a bagel with cream cheese and capers.
