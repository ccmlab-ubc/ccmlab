### About me ###
I am currently a third year student at the University of British Columbia, majoring in Physics with a minor in Chemistry. I am particularly interested in research related to inorganic and quantum materials/technologies and their applications to diverse fields. I initially started in the Neuroscience program at UBC, and my ongoing interest lies in understanding the inner workings of the brain at a granular level through computational and mathematical models. In my free time I enjoy skiing, reading philosophy, and discovering new music.
