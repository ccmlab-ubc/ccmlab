### Open Positions

We are looking for highly motivated and curious graduate students and postdocs to join our team. A background in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, kinesiology, computer science, applied math, physics, or other quantitative subject will be helpful. If interested, send an email to <a href="mailto:hyosub.kim@ubc.ca">Hyosub</a> that includes a statement of interest and your CV. 

For graduate applicants, experience with experimental design, coding, and/or data analysis is desirable but not necessary---a strong interest in the research we do and a drive for discovery are more important than the skills you walk in with!
